## aim

Basically heap aims to be an online market place for scrap metal purchase and sale with tweaks for catalytic converter sale within the state of Maryland, as it is now regulated by law. The goal is to make a sticky app that makes it easy for someone to post a listing, browse and accept offers, and lookup the ratings and information of the business and people they're considering doing business with.

## tools

the idea right now is to use event driven architecture through AWS to log everything to a dynamo instance, send the necessary emails. I'm using React Native to design a project accessible in both android and ios. During development I'm using AppWrite to test DB calls while the actual frontend client is being built.
